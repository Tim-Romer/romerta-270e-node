# romerta-270e-node
Work from Miami University's CSE 270E: NodeJS course. This repository was copied over from a Miami University gitlab repository. Each chapter has its own assignment that goes along with it. The final project is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game that utilizes a node back-end and mongdb to store statistics and games.

The purpose of this repository is to store the work that was completed for this class and for future reference.
